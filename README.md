## ✨ Features

- Pixel-perfect layout based on the Figma design  
- Responsive design with Bootstrap's grid system

## 📌 Notes

This project was a great introduction to converting real UI/UX designs into functional code, reinforcing the importance of layout precision, responsive design, and clean, maintainable code. Although JavaScript was optional, I chose to add interactive elements to go beyond the basic requirements.
